I analyzed my Spotify data to get some insights on my music taste
As the year comes to a close, the anticipation for the Spotify Wrapped experience becomes palpable. The absence of a Spotify wrapped feels like an incomplete chapter in the book of the year. Spotify is one of the most popular streaming audio services, with the most reported paid subscribers, captivating millions of users with its vast library and personalized recommendations.  

Spotify Wrapped is an annual feature offered by the music streaming platform. It offers users a personalized summary of their music listening habits over the previous year. Typically released in December, it includes a variety of insights, including the user's most-played songs, artists, genres, and total listening time. 

In December 2023, with a little hustle, I embarked on a journey to gain insights into my melophile self. In this post I will be sharing some of the highlights. 

1. Artists of the Year 

Creating a captivating word cloud (which I intend to convert into a poster), I highlighted my 30 most streamed artists, adjusting the size of each artist's name based on their respective streaming times. This representation not only visually depicts my musical preferences, but it also emphasizes the importance of each artist in relation to the amount of time devoted to their music.

2. My Songs features 

Spotify provides various audio features of a music track analyzed and quantified by Spotify to enhance the user experience and provide personalized recommendations. Some key Spotify song features include: danceability, energy, speechiness, acousticness, liveness, and valence. Checkout the link - Understanding Spotify features to have an understanding of the listed features. For me the mean value for danceability, energy, speechiness, acousticness, liveness, and valence on a scale of 0-1 had values 0.61, 0.61, 0.09, 0.35, 0.18, and 0.51 respectively. So, I asked ChatGPT to provide insights on my music preferences, and I got the bellow response-  
“These features collectively paint a profile of someone who enjoys music with moderate to high levels of danceability and energy, suggesting a preference for lively and dynamic tunes. The low speechiness value indicates a tendency towards instrumental or less lyric-focused music. The moderate acousticness suggests a balanced taste between electronic and acoustic sounds, while the low liveness suggests a preference for studio-recorded tracks over live performances. The valence score of 0.51 indicates a slightly positive emotional tone in the preferred music.”
